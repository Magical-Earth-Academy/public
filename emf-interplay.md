## Proposal for EMF Interplay Circle Experiment

The EMF Interplay Circle Experiment aims to explore the dynamics of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated during human gatherings. The project involves setting up sensors in 4+1 and 12+1 circle configurations to collect, analyze, and visualize EMF data during synchronized activities, rituals, and movement. Data will be used to study the interaction of human-generated EMFs and external influences, contributing to both scientific understanding and spiritual exploration.

**Technical Specifications (v.0 with assistance from ChatGPT)**

**1. Sensors and Data Collection Equipment**

**Primary Sensors:** Trifield TF2 EMF Meter (Qty: 13). Also suggested GQ EMF-390 Multi-Field EMF Meter for detailed frequency range detection and Cornet ED88T Plus2 as an alternative option.

**Additional Ambient Sensors for Baseline Measurements:** Temperature Sensors (DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor for precise baseline data, Govee Smart Hygrometer Thermometer for Bluetooth-enabled logging), Light Sensors (TSL2561 Digital Luminosity Sensor for visible and infrared light, BH1750 Light Intensity Sensor for lux measurements), Data Logger Integration (USB or wireless data logging capabilities to record EMF fluctuations in real time), 

**Additional Needs:** Placement Stands (adjustable tripods or fixed stands for uniform sensor placement at varying heights), Environmental Controls (shielding equipment to minimize interference from external EMF sources (optional for controlled environments)).

**2. Data Analysis and Visualization Software**

**Software Platforms:** Seaborn for creating visual representations of data. Tableau for interactive dashboards and dynamic visuals. Grafana for real-time monitoring and collaborative analysis. 

**3D Visualization Tools:** Blender for immersive spatial mapping.

**IoT & Cloud Platforms:** ThingSpeak for connecting sensors and visualizing live data streams. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized data storage.

**3. Hardware and Connectivity**

**Central Processing Unit:** Laptop or workstation with sufficient processing power to handle data collection and analysis.

**IoT Devices:** Arduino for integrating sensors into a networked system. Connectivity modules for real-time data streaming.

**Power Supply:** Portable power banks for outdoor setups.

**4. Experiment Setup**

**4+1 Configuration:** 4 sensors placed at cardinal points around the circle. 1 central sensor at chest height.

**12+1 Configuration:** 12 sensors equidistantly around the perimeter. 1 central sensor for group-wide data aggregation.

**Environmental Monitoring:** Use additional sensors to measure ambient EMF levels, temperature, and light for baseline comparison.



## Next Steps

**Review Specifications:** Confirm sensor selection, software tools, and experiment configurations.

**Procure Equipment and Software:** Purchase required items and set up an IoT network.

**Schedule Pilot Test:** Conduct baseline measurements and a test run for both configurations.

**Analyze Results:** Use data to refine placement and methodology.

**Iterate:** Adjust setup based on findings for optimal EMF monitoring.


The estimated budget for equipment only is around US$12,000.
