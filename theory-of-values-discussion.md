We had a first in person meeting at the Infinita pop-up city on 18 January 2025, and a small group discussed value and what a Proof-of-Value (PoV) model could potentially look like. 

This brought to mind Tudor Vianu, and his contributions to the theory of values and the deep relationship between value and values and art, and not being able to find any English translations to share, we asked ChatGPT for help with an English summary by feeding bits of relevant text.

## Tudor Vianu and the Philosophy of Art

Tudor Vianu placed art at the center of the world, aligning it with science and philosophy. In his view, the world was a **process where unstable systems evolve into stable ones**, which he called harmony. He identified the mechanical harmony of the universe as one of the primary sources of the idea of harmony, with art being the second harmonious product of the world. Through art, humans can experience and express this harmony in a tangible and meaningful form.

Vianu argued that the stability of all systems in the world is inherently fragile, but art maintains an incorruptible harmony, unaffected by external factors. While the world continuously strives toward the perfection embodied by art, it can only approximate it, never fully achieving it.

Art, according to Vianu, serves as **a guiding force for human culture**. It offers a model of harmony that can inspire a better society, a nobler moral life, and deeper scientific inquiry. Art provides a blueprint for the glorious destiny of the human spirit, demonstrating that the perfection achieved in art can extend to all human endeavors.

Vianu also explored the concept of **the artist's responsibility within contemporary culture**. He contended that artists should not be confined to depicting only harmonious beauty or classical forms. Instead, modern art must reflect the contrasts and complexities of life while maintaining rigorous form and organization. The artist must exercise strict discipline and pursue excellence, becoming a tenacious representative of the world's organizing forces.

Unlike moral or scientific contributions, which can be built upon by others, a work of art is a unique creation that cannot be revisited or improved by anyone else. Thus, an imperfect artwork represents not only a lost opportunity but also a failure in the human spirit's quest for harmony. Beyond moral responsibility, **the artist carries a metaphysical responsibility** — a duty rooted in their unique role in shaping and reflecting the world’s inherent order.
