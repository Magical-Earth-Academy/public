We had a first in-person meeting at the Infinita pop-up city on 18 January 2025, and a small group discussed value and what a Proof-of-Value (PoV) model could potentially look like. This brought to mind Tudor Vianu, and his contributions to the theory of values and the deep relationship between value and values and art, and not being able to find any English translations to share, we asked ChatGPT for help with an English summary by feeding it bits of relevant text.

## Tudor Vianu and the Philosophy of Art

Tudor Vianu placed art at the center of the world, aligning it with science and philosophy. In his view, the world was a **process where unstable systems evolve into stable ones**, which he called harmony. He identified the mechanical harmony of the universe as one of the primary sources of the idea of harmony, with art being the second harmonious product of the world. Through art, humans can experience and express this harmony in a tangible and meaningful form.

Vianu argued that the stability of all systems in the world is inherently fragile, but art maintains an incorruptible harmony, unaffected by external factors. While the world continuously strives toward the perfection embodied by art, it can only approximate it, never fully achieving it.

Art, according to Vianu, serves as **a guiding force for human culture**. It offers a model of harmony that can inspire a better society, a nobler moral life, and deeper scientific inquiry. Art provides a blueprint for the glorious destiny of the human spirit, demonstrating that the perfection achieved in art can extend to all human endeavors.

Vianu also explored the concept of **the artist's responsibility within contemporary culture**. He contended that artists should not be confined to depicting only harmonious beauty or classical forms. Instead, modern art must reflect the contrasts and complexities of life while maintaining rigorous form and organization. The artist must exercise strict discipline and pursue excellence, becoming a tenacious representative of the world's organizing forces.

Unlike moral or scientific contributions, which can be built upon by others, a work of art is a unique creation that cannot be revisited or improved by anyone else. Thus, an imperfect artwork represents not only a lost opportunity but also a failure in the human spirit's quest for harmony. Beyond moral responsibility, **the artist carries a metaphysical responsibility** — a duty rooted in their unique role in shaping and reflecting the world’s inherent order.

## Tudor Vianu on the Theory of Values - Part I 

Tudor Vianu starts from the differentiation between acts of consciousness, those manifestations of consciousness accompanied by a sense of activity within the self and where the self perceives itself as actively working, and objects of consciousness, manifestations in which the self feels passive. Vianu argues that from the standpoint of consciousness analysis, an object can either be represented as an image or thought of as the external cause of that image. In both cases, they remain objects as the targets of conscious acts, making the original dichotomy between acts and objects a sufficient framework. Separating the facts from their interpretations reveals a fundamental, inalterable truth of internal intuition: consciousness experiences itself as active in some instances and passive in others. 

Then, Vianu explores the relationship between acts of consciousness and their objects, suggesting that changes in acts result in variations in the objects they apprehend. Images, thoughts, emotions, and values take on different forms depending on the nature of the acts that produce them. This implies a functional relationship between acts and objects, where consciousness never possesses a fixed or secure grasp of objects, as variations in its acts continuously alter their perceived structure. However, when focusing strictly on observable facts and discarding theoretical interpretations, acts appear to be apprehensive rather than creative. Internal observation suggests that consciousness does not generate objects from its spontaneity but rather encompasses them, finding them already fully formed at the end of its effort. For example, when recalling a memory, it presents itself as an independent object, fully structured, before consciousness even attempts to retrieve it. Similarly, notions, emotions, and values emerge as pre-existing entities at the conclusion of the act that apprehends them. Consciousness, upon reflection, never perceives itself as creating these objects but only as grasping them.

Next, Vianu explores the nature of unclear emotions, incomplete notions, and erroneous judgments, suggesting that they can arise due to two possible causes. Firstly, such inaccuracies can result from a mismatch between acts and their corresponding objects. For instance, if someone seeking truth relies on acts of feeling or desire rather than acts of reason, they are unlikely to find the truth. This does not imply that truth is the product of a specific act, but rather that it can only be apprehended by a particular type of act suited to it. While acts do not create objects, they determine whether an object can be properly apprehended. Within a specific domain reserved for a certain type of act, secondary or subsidiary acts can apprehend particular kinds of objects. When these acts are substituted with others, the perceived objects may vary, not because acts create them, but because different types of acts are required to apprehend different types of objects. While there may not be a direct functional link between acts and objects, there is a clear correlation between them—one that can either be successful or missed, depending on the appropriateness of the act to the object it seeks to comprehend. 

Vianu classifies conscious acts into four types: representation, thought, feeling, and desire, each corresponding to a specific type of object: images, abstractions, affects, and values, respectively. Representation apprehends images, thought grasps abstractions, feeling experiences affects, and desire encompasses values. While acknowledging the plurality of act types, Vianu does not deny their interplay and mutual influence. In fact, he asserts that in the lived reality of consciousness, it is difficult to find moments where these acts are not simultaneously present and co-adapted. The co-adaptation of acts and objects within consciousness at any given moment is an elementary fact of observation. However, despite their simultaneous occurrence, the theoretical separation of these acts remains possible—just as physiological functions can be studied independently despite their organic convergence.

Vianu argues that acts of consciousness cannot be described, because description is only possible for what can be observed. Observation, in turn, is only possible for either objects (which are static configurations) or acts (processes) whose unfolding is slower than the act of observation itself. He uses the analogy of a rapidly spinning wheel—if its speed surpasses the perceptual capacity, it cannot be observed. Similarly, to observe an act of consciousness, consciousness would need to split into two, with one part acting as the observer and the other as the observed. This notion underscores the inherent difficulty in directly observing conscious acts, as their immediacy and fluid nature prevent traditional forms of examination and description.

At this point, Vianu addresses the longstanding objection against psychology as a science [his work is pre-WW2], which is based on the alleged impossibility of consciousness to observe itself. However, the development of modern psychology has challenged this claim. Despite this, the question remains: Can consciousness truly observe its own acts? Vianu concludes that the acts of consciousness are ultimately unobservable and cannot be described, as their fluid and immediate nature resists the mechanisms of self-examination. He concludes that when a process—such as an act of consciousness—is not directly observable, consciousness adopts an alternative method for describing it. Instead of observing the process itself, it identifies and describes its stages as distinct objects, conceptualizing the act as an unobservable transition from one stage (or object) to another. This approach is commonly used in scientific descriptions of natural processes. Acts of consciousness remain beyond representation, with only their distinct stages becoming accessible to observation. Thus, describing a conscious act means observing the objects that mark its progression or focusing solely on the final object that limits and defines it. However, Vianu citing Wilhelm Dilthey noted that the experience of acts is the proper method for studying the human sciences. This suggests that acts of consciousness might be accessible through an internal lived experience rather than objective observation. Vianu also noted that experiencing an act requires proper orientation—if one directs an act of feeling towards objects of representation, thought, or desire, they will only grasp the emotions associated with these objects, highlighting the importance of alignment between the type of act and its corresponding object.

Next, Vianu explored the alternability of conscious acts, asserting that one act of consciousness can replace another in apprehending the original object of the first act. This is possible due to the previously mentioned co-adaptation of different acts and objects within consciousness. However, when an act is directed toward an unrelated object, it can only grasp what is relevant to its own nature and structure. In essence, while consciousness can attempt to perceive any object from any act's perspective, it will only perceive what is compatible with the specific act's capacity. For example, lived experiences (trăirile) result from an act of feeling directed at objects of thought—sometimes when thought is hindered from functioning effectively. Another example of act alternation occurs when representation is directed toward abstractions, which are the natural objects of thought. The result of this alternation is the creation of schemas, which are fundamental to all sciences. A schema is essentially an abstraction apprehended by representation, or more precisely, an image adapted to abstraction, meaning it represents an object inadequately suited to the act of representation. Vianu notes that when scholars encounter schemas instead of expected abstractions, they perceive it as an improper function of consciousness, which may lead to skepticism regarding the schematic method's reliability. This mismatch highlights the challenges of substituting one type of conscious act for another in an attempt to grasp the correct object.

Vianu highlighted the most general and significant case of the alternability of conscious acts, which occurs when thought engages with representations, affects, and values. When thought is directed at these elements, it ultimately realizes that a core essence—a fundamental aspect of the original representation, affect, or value—remains beyond its grasp. This inherent limitation forms the basis for the criticism of the sciences that attempt to analyze individuality, emotions, and values. The issue arises because what thought captures in an image, affect, or value is not the thing itself, but rather an abstraction adapted to the structural frameworks of consciousness dominated by representation, affect, or value. In other words, thought, when dealing with non-conceptual domains such as emotions or subjective experiences, only processes a simplified version of them, rather than their full, lived reality. This distinction underpins the critiques often aimed at rational approaches to understanding deeply subjective or individualized experiences. 

Next, Vianu examines the nature of myths, defining them as values encompassed by representation—images that have been adapted to the structure of a value, or values apprehended through an inadequate act. In modern classicism, myths were traditionally seen merely as poetic images, objects of representation. However, a major intellectual breakthrough came in the 18th century when Giambattista Vico recognized myths as the result of an inadequate act, shifting their perception from mere representations to abstract conceptions about the structure of the universe or the origins of things, processed through representation. For a long time, myths were regarded as abstractions perceived as images, or more accurately, images coadapted to abstractions within the structure of a particular state of consciousness. Modern research, however, has revealed that myths are more than theoretical explanations of the world imagined by early civilizations. According to Vianu, the true nature of myths lies in their status as non-correlative objects of representation or objects grasped through an inadequate act. The alternation of conscious acts in myths does not occur between representation and thought, but rather between representation and desire.

Vianu drew on the work of Georges Sorel, who, in Reflections on Violence, highlighted the active nature of myths—their ability to mobilize and orient desire. This perspective emphasizes that myths are not just passive stories but dynamically engage human aspirations and motivations. Thus, myths can be understood as values encapsulated by representation, where an image becomes tightly interwoven with value, guiding and shaping cultural and personal meaning. Through the interplay of connections and adaptations within mythical imagery, values are always clarified and reinforced within society.

Vianu explained that not only representation but also other acts of consciousness, such as feeling, can orient themselves toward values. However, when feeling is directed toward values, it does not apprehend the values themselves but rather the affects associated with them, which he terms affects of possession. Since values are the proper objects of desire, the feelings experienced in connection with them relate to the perspective of possession, non-possession, or loss. These affects include the pleasure, delight, or happiness of realized possession, varying based on the significance of the possessed object, the longing for a possible but distant possession, the fear of potential loss and terror of imminent loss when the possession is of great value, or sadness or despair over irreparable loss. Vianu critiqued psychologists of value, who have treated value as a secondary quality of objects, attributing it to the emotional projection that possession generates. 

Vianu argued that by observing the alternation of conscious acts, it becomes possible to distinguish between the affects of possession (emotional responses coadapted to objects of desire) and true values themselves. This distinction brings us closer to understanding the genuine nature of values, advancing the inquiry into their essence.

Vianu drew a distinction between evidence and approval in relation to how consciousness engages with truth and value. When we declare that a scientific abstraction or truth is evident, we mean that it imposes itself upon our intellect, compelling recognition without effort. In contrast, when we approve of a value, it means that our desire actively orients itself toward the value as soon as it is discovered. Evidence is a sign of an external force acting upon the mind - we do not create evidence, but rather passively accept it. Approval, on the other hand, is an affective sign of an internal action - it is an active process where the mind engages and takes ownership of the value. This distinction is reflected in language—we receive evidence but give approval. When desire apprehends a value, it recognizes it, approves of it, and simultaneously appropriates it, adhering to it with the intent of pursuing and reaffirming it continuously. The affect of approval, therefore, is accompanied by the feeling of adherence [or attachment], signifying that consciousness has truly grasped a value. In the lived experience of these affects, consciousness recognizes the presence and authenticity of values.

Vianu explained that thought is the third act of consciousness that can orient itself toward values. However, what thought captures in such cases is not the value itself, but rather an abstraction that has been coadapted to it, which can then function as a subject or predicate in a judgment. He distinguishes between two types of value-related judgments: value judgments where the value appears as the predicate of the statement (e.g. this painting is beautiful), and judgments about values, where the subject or both the subject and predicate are values (e.g., truth is superior to utility). In both cases, Vianu asserted that such judgments do not truly grasp values, as values can only be fully apprehended through acts of desire. Instead, thought deals with abstractions that are related to and adapted to values. This distinction becomes evident in cases where a person can formulate a judgment about a value without actually experiencing or desiring it. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in historical analysis, where historians make judgments about the value of past events, ideas, or characters without directly engaging with those values as lived experiences. 

As a conclusion, Vianu asserted that all judgments formulated by the science of values (axiology) do not directly engage with values themselves. Instead, they deal with abstractions adapted to values, which are the only objects accessible to thought. True values can only be fully apprehended as correlative objects of desire, and not as subjects or predicates within intellectual judgments. Thus, thought can only grasp values in an inadequate form, as conceptual abstractions rather than lived experiences. Consciousness can only approach true values through acts of desire, which means that in doing so, it must forgo theorization or be willing to think about values in an incomplete way. In essence, a theory of values can only be constructed with the understanding that it deals with an imperfect intellectual representation of values, not their full experiential reality.

Next, Vianu argues that the alternation of conscious acts is reversible, meaning that just as thought can replace desire in apprehending values, desire can also replace thought. This occurs when a person who encounters a value judgment or a judgment about values attempts to grasp the associated abstraction through an act of desire, thereby converting it into a true value. This process distinguishes the study of axiological sciences from the study of natural sciences, where value-neutral objects dominate. While a scientist studying nature only needs to engage in acts of thought, the axiologist must make a double effort—alternating between thought and desire—to fully apprehend values. Without the effort to revive values from abstractions, axiology would be a dead science, devoid of real engagement with values and their significance in human life.

Then, Vianu made a critical distinction between goods (bunuri) and things (lucruri), emphasizing that goods are things that have been valorized, meaning they contain values apprehended by desire. Values reside within goods, and consciousness perceives them through desire. Because of this, goods possess what Vianu refers to as "ontological depth," whereas ordinary things—those without value—remain superficial. The act of valorization—the process by which consciousness apprehends value within an object—cannot be applied to just anything. For something to become a good, it must possess a certain structure that allows the spirit to perceive value within it. For example, even a simple stone is not considered a good (such as a building material) unless it possesses a resistant yet friable structure that makes it suitable for construction. In this way, the economic value of the stone becomes evident through its superficial properties, which Vianu refers to as adjective values.

Finally, Vianu distinguishes between things and persons in the process of valorization. Things may invite the act of valorization through their superficial structure, but persons compel us to penetrate their depth. Persons always have depth and value (or non-value), meaning they are never axiologically indifferent. The interplay between how we valorize a person and how they valorize themselves generates a complex series of outcomes that must be carefully analyzed in any comprehensive theory of values.

Vianu also introduced the concept of subalternation in the acts of desire, i.e., types of desire can replace one another in apprehending values. Just as consciousness can alternate between different acts (representation, thought, desire), different acts of desire—such as economic, aesthetic, and moral—can take each other's place, albeit in an inadequate manner. Each type of desire corresponds to a specific value. Economic desire seeks economic value. Aesthetic desire seeks aesthetic value. Moral desire seeks moral value. However, these values can either be apprehended in themselves or as part of a good, where desire takes the form of an act of valorization. If an economic act of desire focuses on an aesthetic good, it does not apprehend the aesthetic value fully but rather the economic aspects of the good that align with its economic concerns (e.g., resale value rather than artistic beauty). The same principle applies when an aesthetic or moral perspective evaluates goods primarily associated with economic value.

Vianu argued that in the sequence of consciousness, desire precedes value, meaning that the act of desire anticipates and encompasses value. He contrasted his view with that of value autonomists, who believe that values exist independently as ontological essences, preceding the acts that apprehend them—such as desire.

Vianu made a distinction between desire conditioned by values and unconditioned desire, referring to the latter as needs, inclinations, or obscure appetites. Many desires, particularly in early human development, arise independently of any value consciousness. Values are exogenous structures, meaning they originate outside of innate human impulses, whereas raw human appetites are endogenous—arising from within the physiological and psychological depths of the individual. These spontaneous impulses are not guided by any appreciation or evaluative criteria but are rather expressions of the body's inherent drives. Obscure desires, such as basic instincts, precede value awareness. Value, as a concept, emerges later in human evolution as a more advanced development of conscious desire. Thus, Vianu positioned value as a later acquisition in human consciousness, emerging as a result of cultural and cognitive development rather than being an inherent, guiding principle from the outset.

Vianu introduced "excentricity" as a defining characteristic of values, meaning that values—and certain other objects of consciousness—are perceived as external structures relative to consciousness itself. Unlike the more general term "objectivity," which applies to all objects of consciousness, excentricity specifically refers to how values appear to lie outside the self, distinct from internal experiences. Excentricity applies not only to values but also to images and abstractions. For example, when we imagine a forest, a house, or a tree, we naturally perceive them as external realities, even though they are representations formed within our minds. Vianu acknowledged the phenomenological distinction between the mental representation of an image and the intentional object it refers to. However, he emphasized that, in immediate experience, we do not perceive images as mere internal phenomena of consciousness but rather as external realities. This suggests that values, like images and abstractions, are also apprehended as external phenomena, rather than as purely subjective constructs.

Vianu further elaborated on the concept of excentricity, arguing that abstract notions, statistical relations, and functional relationships between things are also apprehended as objective and external realities. When we think about abstract concepts or relationships, our consciousness naturally assumes them to exist outside ourselves, rather than as subjective constructs. In contrast, he introduced the idea of concentricity, which characterizes emotions and feelings such as pleasure, pain, anger, fear, or delight. These experiences are inherently felt as internal states of the self and are perceived as subjective phenomena within our personal psychological framework. By comparing the excentricity of abstract concepts and images with the concentricity of emotions, Vianu highlighted a key distinction in consciousness. This distinction between externalized cognition and internalized affect serves to reinforce the idea that consciousness organizes experience by projecting certain elements outward while internalizing others.

Fundamental values such as truth, beauty, and goodness, as well as more specific ones, are perceived as objects that transcend us. Regardless of how they may have been produced within consciousness, the moment they are apprehended, they are perceived as external, objective realities. To truly understand and describe values, Vianu suggested that we should rely on their immediate data rather than speculative theories about their origin. From an experiential standpoint, values are always perceived as external (excentric), while the emotions they evoke—fear, compassion, admiration, freedom, or love—are felt as internal (concentric). For example, when we witness a tragic event, we experience internal emotions such as fear and pity, but the concept of tragedy itself is perceived as external, beyond the self. Similarly, in experiencing beauty, we feel an inner sense of ease and freedom, but beauty as a value is recognized as something that exists independently of us. This distinction is what gives values their sense of durability and authority—we perceive them as objective realities that exist outside and beyond our immediate emotional states.

Vianu made a critical distinction between the excentricity of values and concepts, arguing that while both are perceived as external to consciousness, they differ in their relationship with it. Values are perceived as external yet connected to consciousness; they are objects of desire that exceed the self but remain linked to it through a dynamic relationship. In other words, values are not indifferent to us - they engage our desires and aspirations, forming a continuous connection with consciousness. Concepts, on the other hand, are perceived as external and isolated, meaning they are independent structures that consciousness can apprehend without any emotional or motivational engagement. Concepts are static and indifferent, allowing consciousness to navigate them without the “pulse” of desire. In summary, consciousness interacts with values through desire, making them integral to our lived experience, whereas it interacts with concepts in a neutral and detached manner.

Although abstract concepts are typically perceived as indifferent and isolated objects of consciousness, they can take on a value-laden character when connected to values through acts of desire. This transformation occurs when consciousness, through an appropriate act of desire, apprehends the value associated with an abstraction, such as the pursuit of scientific knowledge. 

Vianu introduced two key ideas: first, abstract concepts can become value-laden. When a scientist engages with abstract ideas, such as scientific principles, they cease to be purely indifferent because the act of desire integrates them with values like truth and intellectual fulfillment. The presence of values coadapted to abstraction makes scientific inquiry an axiological pursuit, giving it purpose and meaning. Secondly, concepts and values must be distinguished.  There are abstract ideas related to values, such as the concepts of truth, goodness, or beauty, which are perceived indifferently as objects of thought. However, the actual values of truth, goodness, and beauty are apprehended through desire and are solidly connected to consciousness. **Vianu emphasized the need to distinguish between the idea of a value and the value itself.** The idea of beauty (concept) can be considered intellectually, while true beauty (value) engages desire and is deeply linked to consciousness.

Vianu established generalization as the second key characteristic of values, comparing them with images, abstractions, and affects. He argues that values share their general nature with abstractions, while images and affects remain individual. Abstractions, such as concepts and laws, apply to a multiplicity of homogeneous cases. A mental image of a specific forest applies only to that forest and remains unique in consciousness. Even if multiple individuals imagine the same forest, their images are distinct and cannot be generalized in the same way as concepts. The notion of "generic images" proposed by Théodule Ribot, which are simplified and vague mental representations accompanying abstract thought, are described by Vianu as intermediary objects, not true images. Like abstractions, values such as truth, beauty, and goodness are perceived as universal principles that apply across contexts and experiences. Unlike emotions such as pleasure or fear, which are tied to specific situations and cannot be generalized, values function at a higher level of abstraction and are applicable across multiple situations and individuals.

**Vianu argued that the generality of values is an intrinsic feature that emerges through the very act of valuing. Although a value is initially grasped by an individual desire, once it is apprehended, consciousness implicitly recognizes its potential universality, meaning that the same value can be experienced by others under similar conditions.**
